            <div class="p">

                    destroying”. Everything that includes splashing, scratching, ripping off, breaking or any other form
                    of ruining the aesthetics of a composition is considered modern in 2018.</p>

                <h2>Color Transitions / Gradients</h2>
                <p>When Instagram changed its logo back in 2016 into a colorful gradient, nobody thought this trend was
                    going to become so huge. It was just the beginning of its rise. Despite the fact that web wasn’t
                    sure about this design technique (everyone was crazy about flat and material back then), here we
                    are, seeing more and more of these colorful gradients.</p>
